# An Autonomous Warehouse

This is a First-Year Collaboration Project at the University of Birmingham Computer Science course. The combined System uses 3 NXT robots to simulate 
a warehouse system, where robots go to pick-up locations, pick up items and deliver them to the drop-off point. The system is also synchronized with a 
GUI on PC side, the communication being established through Bluetooth. The route planning is smart, using the A* algorithm.

Not yet Implemented:
The robots are also able to localize themselves if they get lost using Monte-Carlo localization algorithm by particle filtering.
